# Content Pack v1

`content.schema.json` defines the `content.json` file read by the loader. Its DTOs are plain serializable C# classes for Unity `JsonUtility`; each collection and parameter map is represented by an array.

## Shape

- `packId`, bundle IDs, unit IDs, stage IDs, AI profile IDs, and module IDs use `namespace:local-id` form. All content IDs must be unique across every installed pack; the loader disables packs that claim the same ID.
- `assetBundleManifestPath` points to the Unity manifest AssetBundle produced alongside content bundles. A data-only pack may set `assetBundles` to `[]` and omit the manifest path. Otherwise, every bundle must be listed; the loader checks exact names against the Unity manifest, computes dependency order from `GetDirectDependencies`, and loads dependencies first. A dependency missing from the declared list disables the pack. A pack may declare up to 128 bundles; each bundle path uses `bundles/<lowercase-name>.bundle`, and bundle names cannot be Windows device names such as `con`, `nul`, or `com1`.
- A unit can use a custom bundle source (`assetBundleId`, `balanceAssetName`, `prefabAssetName`, and `cardImageAssetName`) or `nativeTemplateId`. The loader clones a custom prefab under an inactive holder, sets the clone's root `EntityController.entityId` to the unit's namespaced ID, and registers only that clone; it leaves the AssetBundle prefab unchanged. The native mode copies a registered balance row, makes a dormant runtime clone of the native prefab, changes its root `EntityController.entityId` to the new namespaced ID, and routes that row to the clone. It reuses the native card image unless `cardImageAssetName` supplies a replacement Sprite from a bundle. For a custom model, a native-template unit may also set `visualAssetName` and `visualRootPath` and provide `assetBundleId`. The visual asset must be a `GameObject` prefab with at least one enabled Renderer and no missing or `MonoBehaviour` components. The relative Transform path must identify exactly one native subtree containing renderers; the loader disables those renderers and attaches an instance of the bundle prefab while keeping the native gameplay hierarchy and components. Renderers without materials inherit the first native `MeshRenderer` material found in the target subtree; authored bundle materials are kept. The model prefab root is placed at local position zero, identity rotation, and unit scale, so place offsets and scale in its child hierarchy. This adds custom geometry but does not map native animations or rig behavior to the new model. If a template's controller depends on that model-specific animation, movement or weapon visuals may not carry over. `visualAssetName` and `visualRootPath` must be declared together and only with `nativeTemplateId`. A native unit can use the same bundle for its model and optional card Sprite. `balanceOverrides` changes only an allowlist of finite, non-negative numeric fields using invariant-culture strings; enum, flag, ID, prefab, and image fields cannot be changed this way. Native template IDs resolve against the exact game registry at package load.
- A stage can use a custom bundled `StageParametersScriptableObject` (`assetBundleId` and `assetName`) or a loaded native template (`nativeTemplateId`). The loader clones the ScriptableObject before applying the bounded numeric `parameterOverrides`, so it does not edit the original asset. A native stage variant reuses its template's world and blueprint-pool references; it changes progression parameters and can list new unit/AI IDs, but it does not provide a new map layout. Custom maps still need a valid bundled stage asset with world and blueprint-pool references. `mapSizeMin` and `mapSizeMax` define the `Vector2Int` range (1–256), and `isPartOfDemo` is copied to the wrapper. `unitIds` marks new units as blueprint-eligible by setting the game-wide `isAllowedAsBlueprint` row flag; because blueprint pools may be shared and filter against the global entity list, the unit can also become eligible in other native pools whose filters accept it. The stage's pools still filter the available blueprints. `aiProfileIds` names compiled AI profiles added to the default, Heat, and FirstRun progression lists. References may target the current pack, a native game unit, or another pack; cross-pack dependencies load first.
- Offline stage preflight follows the game's map candidates: AI `restrictedToMaps`, then the selected World `restrictedToMaps`, then the progression's available maps. Because `CreateLevelMap` samples from those lists directly, every in-range AI/World restricted map must be active and demo-allowed when applicable. A selected map must have a non-null `restrictedToWorlds` list because the game reads its count. When that restriction is used, every entry must be non-null and active, and demo generation requires every entry to be demo-allowed; the game may choose any listed World for generation. An empty list means no restriction. These checks model the pinned game build and are not in-game runtime proof.
- An AI profile can use a custom bundled prefab or `nativeTemplateId`, which names a loaded native `DefaultAiBehaviour` GameObject exactly. By default, native mode overlays that resource: the profile contributes the existing behaviour and binds its compiled modules whenever that native AI is spawned, so its modules affect every use of that template. Set `scopeToReferencedStages: true` on a native profile to request an isolated alias: the loader clones the native GameObject under a generated `RCL_` resource name, leaves the original template unchanged, and sets the clone's stage range to the contiguous indices of stages in the same pack that reference the profile. This range is calculated against the active progression lists after previously loaded content, so packs do not need to hardcode stage indices. A scoped profile must be used by at least one stage in its declaring pack; another pack cannot widen its scope, and referenced stages must be contiguous. The runtime clone/alias mechanism and its range calculation have local build and offline validation only; no in-game behavior has been confirmed. Custom AI prefabs must start with reserved prefix `RCL_`, be active, contain exactly one `DefaultAiBehaviour`, and have `AiBehaviour.isDeactivated` set to `false`. Rogue Command tags the spawned instance `AI` before its first `Update`; modules execute in manifest order after initialization and each native update, then clean up in reverse order. If a module fails, the loader disables that stack and attempts cleanup for every module. Each module declares `moduleId` and string-pair `parameters`; the registered module validator defines their types and meaning. `sample:scheduled-base-build` uses the game's `DefaultAiBehaviour.CreateBuilding_Static` helper to build a building already present in the active native deck, with cooldown and finite attempt/success limits. `sample:reactive-base-defense` watches for player units attacking an AI building and inserts attack-move counterattacks before selected defenders' current command, preserving that command for later resumption. It limits each response by AI base, defense radius, cooldown, and responder count; it does not add a native AI deck or change the map layout.
- Bundle paths use exactly `bundles/<lowercase-name>.bundle` with forward slashes so the loader, schema, and Unity builder share one format. The validator rejects rooted paths, traversal segments, missing files, reparse points, and DLL files anywhere in the package. Manifest bundles are limited to 64 MiB; each content bundle is limited to 512 MiB; loaded content bundles are limited to 2 GiB across all packs in one game session. The Unity builder applies the per-pack content-bundle limit. It builds chunk-compressed LZ4 output; these on-disk limits do not guarantee peak memory use for externally produced LZMA bundles, which Unity decompresses in memory. The loader keeps each content bundle's input stream open until its AssetBundle is unloaded, as required by Unity for uncompressed or chunk-compressed bundles.

`sample:reactive-base-defense` accepts `baseIndex` (integer 0–31), `cooldownSeconds` (finite 1–60 seconds), `defenseRadiusCells` (finite 1–64 map cells; default 12), and `maxResponders` (integer 1–4; default 2). It reacts only to player units whose attack and attack component are enabled, whose current target is an AI building at that base, and whose target is in range and targetable by the AI. It chooses nearby defenders with enabled movement and attack that are idle or moving, excludes units with pending skill commands or paused command chains, and counts naturally engaged or previously dispatched units toward the cap. It inserts a finite attack-move-to-position command before the selected unit's idle/move order, which the game resumes after that response reaches its destination. Both current native-template sample packs set `scopeToReferencedStages: true`; static inspection found their source AI templates only accept stages 0–1, while appended stages begin at index 9. The loader now derives an isolated alias range for the referenced stages instead of mutating the shared native template. This is a local-build/static-preflight hypothesis only; none of the unit, stage, or AI sample content has been confirmed in a live match.
- Include empty arrays when a section has no entries. The validator reports package-local diagnostics and does not mutate the registry.

## Unit localization

Units may declare `localizations` entries with a game's language ID, a visible `name`, and an optional `description`. Custom-prefab units must provide an `en-US` name; native-template units may omit localizations and inherit the native template's name and description. If the active language has no pack translation, the loader falls back to `en-US`; additional supported game languages are `de-DE`, `ja-JP`, `ko-KR`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `fr-FR`, `pt-BR`, and `ru-RU`. Duplicate or unsupported language IDs disable the package. The loader intercepts `Loca.BlueprintName` and `Loca.BlueprintDescription` for registered mod-unit IDs, so namespaced IDs resolve without editing the game's localization resources.
